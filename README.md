# Project Name: ECE578_Schrodinger_Cat

Project Description
-Schrodinger Cat (what used to be the Einstein robot) is one of the oldest robots in the lab. Schrodinger Cat is made up of a full body (head, arms, and legs controlled by servos) suspended above the ground by a base (which moves via a set of omni-wheels). The servos and motors are controlled with an Arduino Uno microcontroller. We added a Raspberry Pi to the head of the robot to add vision, speech, and a screen to the robot.

# Project Status:
-We implemented text to speech, human/object recognition, and added a new LCD screen with a cat face base and cat faces using a raspberry pi 3. We also used an arduino board to update the servos and omni-wheels
